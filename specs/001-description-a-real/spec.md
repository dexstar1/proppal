## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Client, I want to browse properties, make enquiries, and track the status of my enquiries so that I can find and invest in real estate.
As a Realtor, I want to manage my properties, leads, and enquiries so that I can efficiently manage my real estate business.
As an Affiliate, I want to track my referral links, commission stats, and payouts so that I can monetize my network.
As an Admin, I want to manage the system, view analytics, and handle payouts so that I can ensure the platform runs smoothly.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Client is on the property browsing page, **When** they click on a property, **Then** they should see the property details.
2. **Given** a Realtor is logged in, **When** they navigate to the leads section, **Then** they should see a list of their leads.
3. **Given** an Affiliate is logged in, **When** they view their dashboard, **Then** they should see their referral link and commission stats.
4. **Given** an Admin is logged in, **When** they access the analytics dashboard, **Then** they should see key platform metrics.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a property has no images?
